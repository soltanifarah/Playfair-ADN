The task is to implement a Java encryption/decryption method using a hybrid approach of classical cryptography
(Vigenere) and DNA-based cryptography (Playfair-ADN). The first step involves converting the plaintext into 8-bit binary and then into DNA form using the rule 
(A(00),C(01),G(10),T(11)). The second step involves passing the data through an amino acid table, and in the third step, 
the resulting text is encrypted using the Playfair algorithm with a given key. 
The fourth step involves decrypting the ciphertext using the same Playfair-ADN algorithm.
